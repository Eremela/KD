Main function 
//The main function written clearly and well 


Header file 

//Too much function defined inside a header file

/*According to our style guide functions have to be written 
like this WriteDot(), InitMorse(),WriteDash() and so on */

/*It would have been better if the comment and the function side 
by side and leave one line for the next function */


Morse.cpp


// The function in this file must be written according to our style guide

for example initMorse should be written like InitMorse.
